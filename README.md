Source files for light up Ukulele project

Please forgive the ugly code, I haven't had time to go back and clean up.

This file is designed to accept input from a rotary encoder and display on a 4D systems OLED display and to drive a string of LEDs.  It uses the 4D Goldelox serial library and the Adafruit_NeoPixel library
